## What is CortexON?

Under the hood, CortexON integrates multiple specialized agents that dynamically collaborate to accomplish user-defined objectives. These specialized agents include:

- **Web Agent:** Handles real-time internet searches, data retrieval, and web interactions.
- **File Agent:** Manages file operations, organization, data extraction, and storage tasks.
- **Coder Agent:** Generates, debugs, and optimizes code snippets across various programming languages.
- **Executor Agent:** Executes tasks, manages workflows, and orchestrates inter-agent communications.
- **API Agent:** Integrates seamlessly with external services, APIs, and third-party software to extend automation capabilities.

Together, these agents dynamically coordinate, combining their unique capabilities to effectively automate complex tasks.

## Quick Start Installation

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following required variables:

#### Anthropic API

- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_NAME=claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key`

Obtain your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com).

#### OpenAI API (Required for Deep Research Agent)

- `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4.1`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key`

Obtain your API key from [OpenAI Console](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

#### Browserbase Configuration

- `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=your_browserbase_api_key`
- `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_browserbase_project_id`

Set up your account and project at [Browserbase](https://browserbase.com).

#### Google Custom Search

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key`
- `GOOGLE_CX=your_google_cx_id`

Follow the steps at [Google Custom Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview).

#### Logging

- `LOGFIRE_TOKEN=your_logfire_token`

Create your token at [LogFire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire).

#### Vault Integration(OPTIONAL)

- `VITE_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`
- `VITE_APP_VA_NAMESPACE=your_unique_namespace_id` (format unrestricted, UUID recommended)
- `VA_TOKEN=your_vault_authentication_token`
- `VA_URL=your_vault_service_endpoint`
- `VA_TTL=24h`
- `VA_TOKEN_REFRESH_SECONDS=43200`

This project uses HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault for secure secrets management. While you can either self-host Vault or use HCP Vault, we recommend using HCP Vault for the best managed experience. For HCP Vault Dedicated cluster setup, follow the [official HashiCorp documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/get-started-hcp-vault-dedicated/create-cluster).

#### WebSocket

- `VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8081/ws`

### Configuring External MCP Servers (OPTIONAL)

CortexON supports integration with external MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for extended capabilities. Configure these in the `cortex_on/config/external_mcp_servers.json` file.

#### 1. GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Create a GitHub Account** if you don't already have one at [github.com](https://github.com)

2. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - Follow the steps as listed here: [Personal Access Token Setup](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github#setup)

3. **Add the Token to Your Configuration**:
   - Open `cortex_on/config/external_mcp_servers.json`
   - Find the GitHub section and replace the empty token:
   ```json
   "env": {
     "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_YourTokenHere"
   }
   ```
4. **Sample Queries**
  - Update the README.md file in the <repo_name> repository by <github_username> on branch main. Insert the line "Changed by CortexOn" in the end. Provide the updated file content as the content parameter and set branch as main.
  - List the latest commit and in which repo the commit was made by <github_username>

#### 2. Google Maps API Key

1. **Create a Google Cloud Account**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create an account or sign in with your Google account

2. **Create a New Project**:
   - In the cloud console, click on the project dropdown at the top
   - Click "New Project"
   - Name it (e.g., "CortexON Maps")
   - Click "Create"

3. **Enable the Required APIs**:
   - In your project, go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
   - Search for and enable these APIs:
     * Maps JavaScript API

5. **Add the API Key to Your Configuration**:
   - Open `cortex_on/config/external_mcp_servers.json`
   - Find the Google Maps section and replace the empty key:
   ```json
   "env": {
     "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": "<your-api-key-here>"
   }
   ```
