    "content": "Feedback: The original plan involves opening Amazon's website and then performing a series of actions to search for 'RTX 4060' and extract product details. The current step was to open Amazon's website using the direct URL. However, the browser agent encountered an error while trying to load the page. The error message indicates that the execution context was destroyed, likely due to a navigation issue. This means that the page could not be successfully loaded, and thus we cannot proceed with the search and extraction tasks. Since this is a critical failure at the very first step, it's not possible to continue with the plan.\nTerminate: True\nFinal Response: The task encountered an error while trying to open Amazon's website, which prevented further actions. The error was related to the execution context being destroyed, likely due to a navigation issue. This means the page could not be loaded successfully, and as a result, we cannot proceed with searching for RTX 4060 graphics cards or extracting any product information. I recommend retrying the task or checking the network connection and URL for any issues.",
